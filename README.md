The project Gesture Recognition System named “GesturePY”, is an python based application that is been developed, specifically for deaf-mute people with 
an intention to ease up their interaction during virtual meetups  and conversations with others.

The app has a ‘Sign-to-Text’ conversion feature which converts gestures of left 
hand into messages that are to be send.

It is a desktop application whose GUI is inspired by social media sites like - Whatsapp and Telegram.
